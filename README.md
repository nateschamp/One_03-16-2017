Website Project 1

I'd like to begin by blurting out my intentions for this project. I use messengers at work and in class to talk to people, and figure there are no cool incentives or extras about the process. I love RPG elements like loot and stats, and want to create a casual atmosphere where you and your firneds can chat, raid, and roll for loot. There can be level ups and other RPG elements implemented, but the focus should be on developing a fun experience for people to socialize.
